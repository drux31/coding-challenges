# Coding challenges

This repo is contains the code of the tools I haave been building, followging [coding challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/), from John Crickett.

These challenges are exercises to learn a new programming language or technology, or master a language I already know. Each challenge is about writing full application or tool. Most of which will be based on real world tools and utilities.

Just follow the link to any of the folder to explore the project.
